- Tools to monitor and manage your context usage

## What is a Context Window?

The **context window** is the total amount of text Claude can "see" and remember during a conversation. Think of it as Claude's working memory — everything you've said, every file Claude has read, and every response generated lives in this window.

### Size Matters

Claude's standard context window is **200,000 tokens** (approximately 150,000 words). To put that in perspective:

- **~500 pages** of a typical book
- **~50 average-sized source code files**
- **The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy** could fit with room to spare

There's also a model with a **1 million token** context window available for even larger codebases and longer conversations.

## The Main Context Window

When you start a Claude Code session, everything goes into the **main context window**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Main Context Window               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Your messages                             │
│ • Claude's responses                        │
│ • File contents Claude reads                │
│ • Command outputs                           │
│ • Tool results                              │
│ • System instructions                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every interaction adds to this window. A simple question? A few hundred tokens. Reading a large file? Thousands of tokens. Over a long session, it fills up.

## Agents Have Their Own Context

When Claude spawns a **subagent** (using the Task tool), that agent gets its **own separate context window**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Main Context Window               │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Your conversation with Claude        │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                             │
│  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  │
│  │  Agent 1        │  │  Agent 2        │  │
│  │  (own context)  │  │  (own context)  │  │
│  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is powerful because:
- Agents can do complex work without filling your main context
- Only the agent's **final summary** comes back to your main window
- You can run multiple agents in parallel, each with fresh context

---

## When Context Fills Up

As your context window fills, you may notice:
- Responses slow down (more to process)
- Older parts of the conversation may be forgotten
- Eventually, you'll hit the limit

**Signs you're running low:**
- Claude forgets earlier instructions
- Responses become less coherent
- You see warnings about context limits

---

## Managing Your Context

### Check Your Usage: `/stats`

See how much context (and money) you've used:

```bash
/stats
```

This shows:
- Tokens used in the current session
- Estimated cost
- Context utilization

### View Context Details: `/context`

Get a detailed breakdown of what's in your context window:

```bash
/context
```

This shows:
- How much space each part of the conversation takes
- Which files or tool results are using the most tokens
- Helps identify what to clear or compact

### Clear Everything: `/clear`

Start fresh with an empty context:

```bash
/clear
```

Use this when:
- Starting a new, unrelated task
- Context is cluttered with old information
- You want a clean slate

**Note:** This erases all conversation history — Claude won't remember anything from before.

### Compact Context: `/compact`

Summarize and compress your conversation:

```bash
/compact
```

This:
- Keeps important context (what you're working on)
- Removes verbose details (full file contents, long outputs)
- Lets you continue without losing track of your task

Use `/compact` when:
- You're mid-task but running low on context
- You want to continue but don't need every detail
- The conversation has accumulated a lot of noise

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use agents for big tasks** — They have their own context and only return summaries
2. **Compact regularly** — Don't wait until you hit limits
3. **Clear between projects** — Fresh context for fresh work
4. **Check `/stats` periodically** — Stay aware of your usage

---

## Try It Out

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Have a brief conversation
3. Run `/stats` to see your usage
4. Try `/context` to see what's taking up space
5. Try `/compact` to see how it summarizes
6. Run `/stats` again to see the difference
